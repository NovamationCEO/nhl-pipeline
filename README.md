Coding sample

I should probably move to-dos here and away from Trello, to provide some transparency.

# Currently:

- Today's games initialize at midnight, and also again at noon just in case something has been added.
    - Does that ever happen in the real world?  Probably not.
    - See that the chron works; set to upcoming time instead of 0,12.

- Today's games initialize when the server starts.
    - If this were always running, that wouldn't be an issue; but, this is very much a locally-running sample.
